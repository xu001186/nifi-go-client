  title: NiFi Rest API
  description: |-
    The Rest API provides programmatic access to command and control a NiFi instance in real time. Start and
                                                stop processors, monitor queues, query provenance data, and more. Each endpoint below includes a description,
                                                definitions of the expected input and output, potential response codes, and the authorizations required
                                                to invoke each service.
